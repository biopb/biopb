description: Server-side image-processing ops: what `ops` holds and how to call one.

## Image Processing Ops (`ops`)
`ops` maps op name -> a thin callable that runs one `biopb.image.ProcessImage` op.
Discover and inspect them before use — each carries a docstring with its server, labels,
input-shape hints, and default kwargs:
```python
list(ops)                          # available op names
inspect_object("ops['op_name']")   # docstring, default kwargs, server
```
Call signature: `ops["name"](image, dim_labels=None, **kwargs)`
* `image` as an `np.ndarray` -> sent inline (eager) -> returns an `np.ndarray`.
* `image` as a tensor-server **array_id str** -> sent as a lazy reference (the
  op server pulls pixels straight from the tensor server, no kernel
  round-trip) -> the result is uploaded back to the tensor server and a new
  **array_id str** is returned, so ops chain lazily on large data:
```python
labels = ops["cellpose_cyto2"](arr)          # ndarray -> ndarray
seg_id = ops["cellpose_cyto2"]("raw_data_id") # id -> id (lazy, large data)
viewer.add_tensor(seg_id)                    # view it, where there is a window
```
